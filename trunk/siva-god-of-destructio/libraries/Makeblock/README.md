Library for Makeblock electronic modules

This library is for replacing the Me_Lib_V2.0, the library is rebuild and improved, we recommand Makeblock customers using this library to replace the old one. 

How to use:

1.Before programming, we have to make a copy of libraries to the Arduino default library path. The default path is usually in "C:\Users\user name\Documents\Arduino\libraries" (Windows 7),"/Users/username/Documents/Arduino/libraries" on OSX.

2.Open the Arduino Application. If already open it, you need to restart.

3.Click "File->Examples". Here are some test program.
