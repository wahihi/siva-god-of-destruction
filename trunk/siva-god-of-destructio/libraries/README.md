Makeblock Library
=============

Library for Makeblock electronic modules

This library is for replacing the Me_Lib_V2.0, the library is rebuild and improved, we recommand Makeblock customers using this library to replace the old one. 

How to use:

1.Before programming, we have to make a copy of libraries to the Arduino default library path. The default path is usually in "C:\Users\user name\Documents\Arduino\libraries" (Windows 7),"/Users/username/Documents/Arduino/libraries" on OSX.

Your Arduino library folder should now look like this (on Windows):

  My Documents\Arduino\libraries\Makeblock\Makeblock.cpp
  
  My Documents\Arduino\libraries\Makeblock\Makeblock.h
  
  My Documents\Arduino\libraries\Makeblock\examples
  ....

or like this (on Mac):

  Documents/Arduino/libraries/Makeblock/Makeblock.cpp
  
  Documents/Arduino/libraries/Makeblock/Makeblock.h
  
  Documents/Arduino/libraries/Makeblock/examples
  ...

or similarly for Linux. 

2.Open the Arduino Application. If already open it, you need to restart.

3.Click "File->Examples". Here are some test program.
